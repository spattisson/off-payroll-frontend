<p class="form-hint">
	The way you get paid can be a pointer towards employment or self-employment. For example, people who submit invoices and are paid a daily rate are more likely to be acting like a business. People who get a regular payment based on a weekly rate are more likely to be acting like an employee. The more you act like an employee, the more likely it is that, in HMRC's view, you should pay tax on payroll.
