	Example A) A computer programmer for a bank is contracted to work from the bank's office for 37 hours per week. She has to work her hours between 8 am and 6 pm, Monday to Friday. She's allowed two 30-minute tea breaks: one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Her lunch break must last no more than one hour. If she wants to leave the office, she has to get permission from her manager. She has to make any holiday requests at least two weeks before the holiday. The computer programmer is working more like an employee than a business. This means that, in HMRC's view, it's more likely that she should be paying tax on payroll.

	Example B) A writer has a contract to write an article for a magazine. The article must be submitted to the magazine editor by 31 October. Apart from the deadline, the writer is free to work on the article whenever he wants to. The writer is acting more like a business than an employee. This means that, in HMRC's view, it's less likely that he should be paying tax on payroll.
