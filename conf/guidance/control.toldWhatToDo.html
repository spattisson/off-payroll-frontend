	Example A) A painter is taken on by a builder, to do general painting jobs on site. If the painter can be moved from job to job as the builder's priorities change, the builder has control over what the painter must do. The painter would be acting more like an employee. This means it's more likely she should pay tax on payroll.

	Example B) A painter is taken on by a builder, to complete a specific painting job. If the painter can't be told to move to another job, the builder doesn't have control over what the painter must do. The builder can ask, and the painter can say no. In this case, the painter is acting more like a business than an employee. This means it's less likely that she should pay tax on payroll.
