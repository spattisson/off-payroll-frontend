	Example A) A market researcher is given detailed instructions on who to interview, what questions to ask, how to order the questions and how to ask the questions. He doesn't have much say over how to do the job. He's working more like an employee than a business. This means it's more likely that, in HMRC's view, he should pay tax on payroll.

<p class="form-hint">
	Example B) A plasterer is contracted by a builder to plaster four houses in a good and workmanlike manner. The builder will only pay the plasterer if the work is done to a satisfactory standard. The builder does a quality control check, but she has no control over how the plasterer does the work. The plasterer is working more like a business than an employee. This means that, in HMRC's view, it's less likely that he should pay tax on payroll.
