	Example A) An accountant enters a contract to provide accountancy services to a company. The contract states that the accountant must work at the companyâ€™s offices. The accountant travels to the same office every day, to do the work. She's acting more like an employee than a business. This means it's more likely that she should pay tax on payroll.

	Example B) Another accountant enters a contract to provide accountancy services to the same company. This time the contract states that the accountant can work at the office, at home, or wherever he chooses. The accountant has an office in his home. He has to cover the costs of that office himself. He is acting more like a business than an employee. This means it's less likely that he should pay tax on payroll.

	Example C) A cleaner is contracted to clean an office block five evenings a week. The nature of the work dictates where the work has to be done. This factor is not likely to have any sway in deciding the cleaner's status in this case.
