    Example: Tom's personal service company has 500 ordinary shares and 500 non-voting preference shares. Tom owns all of the preference shares and the other 500 shares are owned by his friend Sheryl. The preference shares conditions are that Tom will receive at least 5% of any dividend that the company makes. Therefore this rule is met.
