    HMRC's view is that anyone doing the job of an office holder is acting more like an employee than a business. This means it's more likely that office holders should pay tax on payroll.   
</p>
<p class="form-hint">
    An office holder is someone who’s been appointed to a position by a company or organisation. This includes, but is not limited to:  
</p>
<ul class="form-hint bullets">
	<li>Statutory appointments, eg registered company directors or secretaries, board members of statutory bodies, or crown appointments</li>
	<li>Appointments under the internal constitution of an organisation, eg club treasurers or trade union secretaries</li>
	<li>Appointments under a trust deed, eg trustees - ecclesiastical appointment, eg members of the clergy</li>  
</ul>
<p class="form-hint">
    Office holders are neither employees nor workers. However, it’s possible for someone to be an office holder and an employee if they have an employment contract with the same company or organisation that meets the criteria for employees.
